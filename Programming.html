    <p>Programming is something I've been very interested in since a young boy as my uncle Shaun who lived with me for a few years was
    very good at it. I used to play Gmod on my laptop and mess with the console becasue it was like coding and when I was twelve my uncle helped me to build a pc
    although I had been planning (and saving) for awhile. I did computer since GCSE and learnt python, unfortunatley I wasn't a huge fan of school but still enjoyed
    coding. That was pretty much the only HW I liked to do. To make matters worse the year I took the GCSE's all the practical wasn't graded what killed my motivation, leading me to fail
    the subject. Still I don't think my GCSE's should determine if I'm good at something or not and am choosing to purse a courier in Programming.</p>
