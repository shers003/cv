    <p>Boxing has been a massive influence in my life since I was a young boy my
    Dad has been taking me on pads at home. My first year of secondary school wasn't
    very fun so my Dad made me go to an amture Boxing club named <a href="https://www.doublejabboxing.com/">Double jab</a>
    where I went on to have <strong>seven ameture boxing matches</strong> winning four and
    plan on doing more. I think it's a good sport to do as as a programmer as you need to be very good at problem
    solving. It's also helped me alot with being confident in myself and I believe the skills will take me far in life.
